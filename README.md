# Workflow CA - Jenny Feragen

In this CA we are learning how to set up tests for a application - to help us better the process of coding.
The application is not my own, I've borrowed a Noroff Social Media App project.

## Get started

First of all:
Download the repo and set it up at a destination of your choosing. Then open the code in you prefered editor.
Mine is VSCode.

Initialize git in the project folder:

```
git init
```

Install dependencies

```
npm i
```

Build SASS

```
npm run build
```

The site is setup to be viewed in Vite, to do so run:

```
npm run dev
```
